# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to the **Machine_Learning_Projects** repository!  
This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects that were presented during a two-session workshop where I participated as the **instructor**. The workshop aimed to introduce essential machine learning concepts through hands-on, real-world projects.
